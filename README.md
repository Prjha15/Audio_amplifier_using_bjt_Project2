 ðŸ”Š ***Simple BJT Audio Amplifier (Common Emitter)***
 

This project is a **minimal audio amplifier circuit** using a single **NPN BJT** in **common emitter configuration**. It takes a weak microphone signal and amplifies it enough to be used with basic audio devices like headphones or an oscilloscope.

#THE ABOVE CIRCUIT IS DESIGNED LT SPICE ,SO WE WILL BE USING AC SIGNAL OF LOW FREQUENCY IN PLACE OF MICROPHONE AS LT SPICE DO NOT SUPPORT MICROPHONE.


ðŸŽ¯ Objective

- Design and build a **basic analog audio amplifier**.
- Learn the operation of a **BJT common emitter stage**.
- Practice circuit biasing and AC signal amplification.

ðŸ§© Key Features

- Single transistor 
- Capacitive coupling for input signal
- Suitable for small signal audio from electret microphones
- Beginner-friendly design with minimal components
